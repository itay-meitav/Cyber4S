# Task 1 - Prepare thy data

CSVs were created in the 70s (1972 specifically).

Here's some 1972 songs you can listen to while working on this task:
* [Bill Withers - Lean On Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkaexjc-1os)
* [Neil Young - Heart of Gold - 1972](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHA2lFdEAtA)
* [Deep Purple - Smoke on the Water (Live 1972)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlHEdkL1VoM)
## Instructions

1. Create 3 tables: for artists, albums and songs.
  * Use the fields described in the CSVs.
  * Make sure to add a foreign key constraint.
  * Note that creation order matters - a foreign key on table A assumes table A already exists ([meme](https://i.imgflip.com/1jqcf8.jpg)).

2. Import the CSVs into the tables.


Note: You can use "DB Browser for SQLite" for this task. It's quite convenient. You can install it from the "Ubuntu Software" desktop app.
