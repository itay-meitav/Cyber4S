React Socks Panel Project Itay Meitav

Heroku project link: https://cyber4s-socks-react.herokuapp.com/

The structure of the project:
Both client and server folders are git repositories 
so if you want to run it locally you will need to run in each of them npm ci
and then in 2 separated terminals npm start

Have Fun!
