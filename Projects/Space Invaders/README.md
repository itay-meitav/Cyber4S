Guess what else is coming out this year? It's a game you've been working on called [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders).

Your name is Tomohiro Nishikado. You are Japanese. You work at Taito (more on that later). You started working there in 1968, right after school. You developed a few arcade games, and then spent six months reverse engineering Atari's Pong game.

In 1978 your game called Space Invaders gets released. It will become the company's most popular game and one of the most popular games in arcade history.

Your company, Taito, was actually founded in 1944 in China by a Jewish Ukrainian named Michael Kogan. The company did floor coverings, wigs and hair brushes. 
Fearing Chinese communism, Kogan moved all operations to Japan. He tried selling clothes, then making vodka, then vending machines for peanuts and perfumes. Then jukeboxes. then electronic game machines. Then arcade videogame machines. Wow...


Back to our story..

Tomohiro, your job is to build Space Invaders. Since it's 1978, you only have a text-based interface. HTML and CSS haven't been invented yet.

Even though it's text-based, you have a lot of artistic freedom. Feel free to be creative in the way the game works. How it looks and behaves. Our only guidelines are:

* Use curses for the UI. You have some examples in the `curses_examples` section to get you started.
* Use classes to organize your code. For example: Game, Spaceship, Missile.
* Use modules (separate code into files)

Ganbatte, Nishikado San!
